# üß† Signal Processing Roadmap (Project-Based Learning)

Welcome to the **Signal Processing Roadmap**, a hands-on, project-based journey to master the fundamentals and applications of signal processing across various domains ‚Äî from audio and biomedical signals to radar, IoT, finance, and AI.

This repo contains **16 weeks of structured content** with interactive Jupyter Notebooks, code, datasets, and real-world use cases.
